# OwnThat

This is a web app with REST API interface to help lock resources between
independent executor processes.

e.g. you have a number of executors doing some tasks on random machines.
They can use this app to reserve resources to avoid duplicate work.

Or one can have pools of resources and allow executor processes reserve from
them.
